# Design history

Moved here from `js/packages/config/design/grammar/` in mcurcio/rasl (PR #2). The grammar files now live in `grammar/` (`Rasl.g4` became `Villanelle.g4`; `config.ebnf` became `villanelle.ebnf`).

## Original index

Design work for the formal grammar of the `@rasl/config` language and the three layers on top
of it (bead `rasl-g7n`). This folder collects the design as it develops. No parser code changes here.

Owner requirements (2026-10-21):

- "I think we need a formal EBNF that describes the language so that we can prove its sound"
- Sound = "Both": (a) the grammar is unambiguous, so every valid input has exactly one parse,
  checked by a tool; (b) the parser accepts exactly the grammar's language
- "An EBNF gives a language independent syntax. And then parsers can be written against it,
  and then finally language-specific idiomatic sugar APIs can be layered on top"
- "the TS *config* is canonical. The python version of the full runtime is still more
  comprehensive"
- Slice forms `[n:m]`, `[n:]` and `[:m]` are allowed; `[:]` is rejected (`rasl-9ze.1`)

## Contents

**Start with [RECORD.md](RECORD.md)**: requirements, answers, current choices and the bead outline.

| Path | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [v1-draft.md](v1-draft.md) | First draft: EBNF, where the code and the old rules disagree, soundness plan, layer interfaces | Superseded: failed review |
| [v1-review.md](v1-review.md) | Adversarial review of v1 (verdict: wrong premise) | Done |
| `experiments/v1-draft/` | The v1 grammar written for Lezer, Lark, Bison, ANTLR and an LL(1) check, plus probe scripts run against today's lexer and parser | Evidence for v1 |
| `experiments/v1-review/` | The reviewer's Lezer probes (precedence order, error-token encoding) | Evidence for the review |
| [Rasl.g4](Rasl.g4) | **The grammar** (ANTLR4): the one file that defines the language | Current |
| [config.ebnf](config.ebnf) | The same grammar as W3C EBNF: the readable view and the test reference | Current |
| [v2-draft.md](v2-draft.md) | Revision 2: the grammar, the soundness evidence, the three layers, the three questions | Superseded in part by the answer page |
| `experiments/v2/` | The REx and Bison checks, planted-bad grammars, the oracle and the test harnesses, and a repro of a REx bug | Evidence for v2 |
| [v2-review.md](v2-review.md) | Adversarial review of v2: the grammar held; the evidence claims were corrected | Done |
| [v3-generators.md](v3-generators.md) | After the answers: tree-sitter, ANTLR4, REx and Lark run on the same grammar; recommended tree-sitter | Superseded: failed review |
| [v3-review.md](v3-review.md) | Review of the tree-sitter recommendation; the measured data favours ANTLR4 | Done |
| [q2-examples.md](q2-examples.md) | 14 config lines showing what each Q2 option does, with points and counterpoints | Done |
| `experiments/v4/` | ANTLR4 check: CST adapters, recovery in TS and Python, .g4-to-Bison and token-overlap checks, planted grammars | Evidence for the choice |
| `experiments/v3/`, `experiments/q2/` | The generator ports, planted conflicts, harnesses and Q2 cases | Evidence |
| [gate.html](gate.html) | Source of the answer page (round 2: Q2 spacing, Q3 generator), published at https://claude.ai/artifact/H64AiZ7yuHTkzod9WauPLf | Answered (round 2) |

The experiment scripts were run from a scratch directory outside the repo, so their import
paths and tool installs (npx, uvx) are not wired into this package. They are a record, not a
test suite.
