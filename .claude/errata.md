## 2026-10-28, milestone 1 spec (vil-fy4), architect

- `spec/schema/api.json` (first draft) listed `format diagnostic` in the shared layer, but it takes a
  `document graph`, a low-level type, so shared would import the low level. Moved to the written
  layer in the schema; frozen-m1.md section 4 says where each binding puts it.
- The first draft of this milestone's spec (uncommitted) recorded the owner's answer 1 as "B
  graph.render()" with the low level depending on the rendered layer, and withdrew the round 13
  low-level value type for `extension use`. Superseded by his clarification (2026-10-29: "The low
  level shouldn't "depend on" the middle layer"): spec 5, 6.2, 7.0 now say `render(graph)` in the
  rendered layer, and `extension use` holds the new shared `expanded value` (spec 2.9).
- `AGENTS.md` ("Landing work") says to push directly to `main` and not open pull requests (owner,
  2026-10-22), while this work lands on `docs/binding-spec` through PR 5 and the global rules say
  never push to `main`. Not changed here; the owner should say which holds now.

## 2026-10-28, milestone 1 generator and public-name check (vil-fy4 part 2), build tooling

- `spec/schema/api.json` lists `kind` as a member of `place`, `override` and `change`, but
  frozen-m1.md (section 1, "Shared records") and the schema's own `disagreements` defer Python's
  `kind` on `Place`, `Override` and the change classes to root cause 3. The schema has no way to
  say "absent in one binding until a later milestone", so `py/tests/test_api_names.py` fails on
  those three for the whole milestone, while frozen-m1.md section 9.3 says the check passes when a
  lane is done. Either Python adds `kind` now, or the schema gets a per-binding deferral marker
  (for example `"later": {"py": "root cause 3"}` on the member) that both checks honour. The checks
  were not weakened to guess one.
- A member's `spell` mixes four things: a name (`as_word`, `length`), a call shape
  (`load(path, { overrides })`), a type (`ReadonlyMap<string, string>`,
  `Mapping[str, str] (...)`) and prose (`the block itself is a Sequence`,
  `with diagnostics.collecting():`, `len(diagnostics)`). Both name checks read it by pattern and
  fail on a spell they cannot read, but a tool should not have to parse prose: split it into
  `name` (the attribute) and `signature` (for people).
- frozen-m1.md section 6 says to keep ruff checking the generated `py/src/villanelle/_api/`. Ruff
  skips git-ignored files by default (`ruff check src/villanelle/_api` prints "No Python files
  found"), so once the folder is ignored, `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` never see it
  (mypy does). The generator's output passes both with `--no-respect-gitignore`; keeping it
  checked in CI needs a pyproject change (Python lane).

## 2026-10-28, milestone 1 Python lane (vil-094)

- The check of an override (frozen-m1.md section 3, spec 6.3) runs the text "as the values of `x <text>`", but
  the values check both bindings share (`values_text_problems` / `valuesTextProblems`) does not treat a line break
  as the end of the values: `"1\n2"` passed it, and the old `set_handed` then read only `1`, dropping `2`
  silently. Python's one check now refuses it (BadTextError E2001 at the `2`, test
  `test_load_and_set_override_refuse_an_override_text_alike`); the TypeScript lane should do the same so the
  bindings agree. The same gap remains in the edits: `stmt.set("1\n2")` on `port 80;` writes `port 1\n2;`, which
  parses as two statements. Not changed here (an edit-check behaviour change for both bindings); it needs its own
  bead and, if wanted, a written conformance case.
- `py/tests/test_api_names.py` still fails `place.kind`, `override.kind` and `change.kind` (the erratum above from
  the build-tooling lane): frozen-m1.md section 1 and the schema's own `disagreements` defer those to root cause 3,
  so the Python lane did not add them. Section 9.3 ("the public-name check passes") cannot hold for Python until
  the schema can mark a member as deferred per binding, or the owner moves those three into milestone 1.
